                \nA: It\'s an ugly day today.

                \nB: I know. I think it may rain.

                \nA: It\'s the middle of summer, it shouldn\'t rain today.

                \nB: That would be weird.

                \nA: Yeah, especially since it\'s ninety degrees outside.

                \nB: I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.

                \nA: Yes, it would be.

                \nB: I really wish it wasn\'t so hot every day.

                \nA: Me too. I can\'t wait until winter.

                \nB: I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.

                \nA: I\'d rather be cold than hot.

                \nB: Me too.

                 Repeat

                \nA: It doesn\'t look very nice outside today.

                \nB: You\'re right. I think it\'s going to rain later.

                \nA: In the middle of the summer, it shouldn\'t be raining.

                \nB: That wouldn\'t seem right.

                \nA: Considering that it\'s over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.

                \nB: Exactly, it wouldn\'t be nice if it started raining. It\'s too hot.

                \nA: I know, you're absolutely right.

                \nB: I wish it would cool off one day.

                \nA: That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon.

                \nB: I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.

                \nA: I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot.

                \nB: That's exactly how I feel.

                \nA: I wish it was a nicer day today.

                \nB: That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.

                \nA: It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.

                \nB: It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.

                \nA: It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.

                \nB: Any rain right now would be pointless.

                \nA: That's right, it really would be.

                \nB: I want it to cool down some.

                \nA: I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.

                \nB: Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.

                \nA: I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.

                \nB: I feel the same way.
